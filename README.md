# Major-Project

A game played with gestures. Pong a 2d table tennis like game which used to be played using keyboard can now be played with gestures.
User has to train the application with the gestures to move the paddles. The webcam will be working on another tab so the data is sent in real time from the webcam tab to the pong game tab where the gesture controls the paddle.
